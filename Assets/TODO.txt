TODO:
AI
	- AI Behaviors
	- AI Movement
	- AI Using Abilities
	- AI Ability indicators in the world for where attacks are going to be (Maybe?)
		- This will typically be shown X amount of time prior to using the ability
	- Implement Pet AI (Totems, Golems, etc)
Animation
	- Make the animation system + locomotion not feel so jerky when having to stutter step to get just a little bit closer to attack
Entity Interactions
	- Implement different types of interactions with Entities. For example, some entities we might attack, some we might interact with (NPC), some we might harvest resources from, etc
Gamemodes
	- Additional GameModes (Such as Boss Rush where you face of against some number of bosses one after another and attempt to defeat them all)
Gameplay
	- We should pass damage around as a struct so we can specify the types of damage it is
	- Leveling
		- Player Level System for stats and abilities
Input
	- Controller Support via ControllerLocomotion class
	- Add Support for Input Chords (A use case will be for Smart Casting)
Network
	- Multiplayer Integration
	- Multiplayer difficulty scaling
Rendering
	- Fog of war
	- Update the outline shader to be a toon shader, hopefully this will make the outline better
Settings
	- Settings Menu (Audio/Video/Gameplay/etc)
Status Effects
	- Implement Status Effect system
	- Render Status Effects on the players UI and below (Non-Local Player) Enties health bar
UI
	- Render Health Bars above (Non-Local Player) Entities Heads, small if they've not been hurt before, and larger if they've been hurt or had status effects applied to
	- Implement UI Interaction with Mouse (Ability clicking, tooltip hovering, etc) We'll need to have the InputManager decide what we're suppose to be interacting with first before it sends GameEvents
VFX Graph
	- Investigate the VFX Graph as the solution we use for our ability effects


BUGS
- Spell Indicators won't disappear for an ability if we go to press another ability that we don't have enough mana to cast
- Spell Indicators won't disappear when Channel or Toggle abilities are pressed
