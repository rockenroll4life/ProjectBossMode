UI
	- Ability Selector (Some way to customize your build)

Buffs / Debuffs
	- General system for adding positive and negative effects to entities either timed or until removed

Items / Equipment
	- Decide if items are going to be a thing, and if so add the necessary fixing (UI)
	- Regardless of the above choice, support an Equipment system (May just be fixed equipment for each character)

Abilities
	- Figure out how to support togglable effects
	- System supports a class-less system, however for the purposes of this project we use "classes" (Fixed abilities on a given character)
	- Decide on a ability manipulation system, probably some Hybrid of D3/Wolcen (Fixed choosable upgrades) and POE (Socketed Gems)
	- Abstract abilities out of Player and into their own class (Ideally there's very minimal logic within Player and abilities self handle themselves, abilities know little too nothing about players)

Locomotion
	- Stop using Navmesh Agent for actual moving around, use it to assist us with getting paths, but actually do the movement ourselves
	- Move towards target (attack or ability cast range)
	- Move towards target location (within ability cast range)
	- Follow targeted enemy (Attack Range)

Loot Generator / Manager
	- You know, that loot-y goodness

Statistics
	- Generally just fun info to know, even if it rarely effects gameplay (Can also be used for challenge related things or even achievements)

Achievements
	- General system to support Achievements (Added hooks to go outwards for things like Steam), even if we don't use it
