TODO:
AI
	- AI Behaviors
	- AI Movement
	- AI Using Abilities
	- AI Ability indicators in the world for where attacks are going to be (Maybe?)
		- This will typically be shown X amount of time prior to using the ability
	- Implement Pet AI (Totems, Golems, etc)
Entity Interactions
	- Implement different types of interactions with Entities. For example, some entities we might attack, some we might interact with (NPC), some we might harvest resources from, etc
Gamemodes
	- Boss Rush Gamemode
	- Hero Defense Gamemode
Gameplay
	- We should pass damage around as a struct so we can specify the types of damage it is
	- Leveling
		- Player Level System for stats and abilities
	- Multiplayer difficulty scaling
Input
	- Controller
		- Controller Support via ControllerLocomotion class
		- Controller Support via PlayerControllerTargeter class
	- Keyboard
		- Add Support for Input Chords (Ctrl + ???, Alt + ???, etc) (A use case will be for Smart Casting)
Network
	- Multiplayer Integration
Rendering
	- Fog of war
	- Update the outline shader to be a toon shader, hopefully this will make the outline better
Settings
	- Audio Settings Data
	- Video Settings Data
	- Gameplay Settings Data
	- Settings Menu (To support the data)
		- This should ideally be scriptable/data driven for easy modification
Status Effects
	- Implement Status Effect system
UI
	- Implement Controller UI (Ability buttons are moved to the right button of the screen and are in the diamond shape)
	- Render Health Bars above (Non-Local Player) Entities Heads, small if they've not been hurt before, and larger if they've been hurt or had status effects applied to
	- Implement UI Interaction with Mouse (Ability clicking, tooltip hovering, etc) We'll need to have the InputManager decide what we're suppose to be interacting with first before it sends GameEvents
	- Render Status Effects on the players UI and below (Non-Local Player) Enties health bar
VFX Graph
	- Investigate the VFX Graph as the solution we use for our ability effects


BUGS
- Spell Indicators won't disappear for an ability if we go to press another ability that we don't have enough mana to cast
- Spell Indicators won't disappear when Channel or Toggle abilities are pressed
