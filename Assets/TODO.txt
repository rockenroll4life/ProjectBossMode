- Render Health Bars above (Non-Local Player) Entities Heads, small if they've not been hurt before, and larger if they've been hurt or had status effects applied to
- Render Status Effects on the players UI and below (Non-Local Player) Enties health bar
- Implement an AI Goal and Goal Selector system, based of how Minecraft does it as it's quite elegant
- Implement different types of interactions with Entities. For example, some entities we might attack, some we might interact with (NPC), some we might harvest resources from, etc
