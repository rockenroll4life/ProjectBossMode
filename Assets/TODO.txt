UI
	- QWER ability + cooldown icons for in-game
	- Ability Selector (Some way to customize your build)

Items / Equipment
	- Decide if items are going to be a thing, and if so add the necessary fixing (UI)
	- Regardless of the above choice, support an Equipment system (May just be fixed equipment for each character)

Abilities
	- System supports a class-less system, however for the purposes of this project we use "classes" (Fixed abilities on a given character)
	- Decide on a ability manipulation system, probably some Hybrid of D3/Wolcen (Fixed choosable upgrades) and POE (Socketed Gems)
	- Abstract abilities out of Player and into their own class (Ideally there's very minimal logic within Player and abilities self handle themselves, abilities know little too nothing about players)

Locomotion
	- Stop using Navmesh Agent for actual moving around, use it to assist us with getting paths, but actually do the movement ourselves

Statistics
	- Generally just fun info to know, even if it rarely effects gameplay (Can also be used for challenge related things or even achievements)

Achievements
	- General system to support Achievements (Added hooks to go outwards for things like Steam), even if we don't use it
