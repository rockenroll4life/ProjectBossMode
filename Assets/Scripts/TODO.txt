TODO
- Enum Factories for Goals, and World Events
- Implement Pet AI (Totems, Golems, etc)
- Player Level System for stats and abilities
- Render Health Bars above (Non-Local Player) Entities Heads, small if they've not been hurt before, and larger if they've been hurt or had status effects applied to
- We should pass damage around as a struct so we can specify the types of damage it is
- Update the outline shader to be a toon shader, hopefully this will make the outline better
- Implement UI Interaction with Mouse (Ability clicking, tooltip hovering, etc) We'll need to have the InputManager decide what we're suppose to be interacting with first before it sends GameEvents
- Add Support for Input Chords (A use case will be for Smart Casting)
- Controller Support
- Implement different types of interactions with Entities. For example, some entities we might attack, some we might interact with (NPC), some we might harvest resources from, etc
- Implement Status Effect system
- Render Status Effects on the players UI and below (Non-Local Player) Enties health bar
- Make the animation system + locomotion not feel so jerky when having to stutter step to get just a little bit closer to attack
- Fog of war
- Multiplayer Integration
- Multiplayer difficulty scaling
- Additional GameModes (Such as Boss Rush where you face of against some number of bosses one after another and attempt to defeat them all)
- Decouple Entities from GameObjects

BUGS
- Spell Indicators won't disappear for an ability if we go to press another ability that we don't have enough mana to cast
- Spell Indicators won't disappear when Channel or Toggle abilities are pressed
